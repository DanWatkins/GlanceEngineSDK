- Add a bring to front method to call when an element is clicked on
- Add whitelist and blacklist for what elements can be added as children to others
X Make Update, Draw, AddChild, and simmilar methods protected for gui::Element so external systems don't mess with it
- Add a center in rect method to gui::Text so it can easily be centered in a rectangular area (it returns and offset vector)
- Optimize io directory iteration to calculate the total size of a directory
X Remove all unnessesary occurences of double types in the GUI. Elements don't need positions and sizes finer than pixels (lol)
X Make ge::Vector2D<int> called Point2D, and make it a template because sometimes integers are more appropriate than doubles
X Make the use of floats and ints more logical in ge::Sprite, ge::SpriteFill, and ge::SpriteFrame

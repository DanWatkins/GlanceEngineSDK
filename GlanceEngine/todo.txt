X GUI Root Create methods should return a WeakPtr<T> to the element they create (T should be the type of element created)
X Add a typedef or something to abbreviate std::tr1::dynamic_pointer_cast<T>() to something like DynamicPtrCast<T>()
X Fix the messed up sprite frames on the Linux and MSVC9 builds
X Add a bring to front method to call when an element is clicked on
- Add whitelist and blacklist for what elements can be added as children to others
X Make Update, Draw, AddChild, and simmilar methods protected for Element so external systems don't mess with it
- Add a center in rect method to Text so it can easily be centered in a rectangular area (it returns and offset vector)
- Optimize io directory iteration to calculate the total size of a directory
X Remove all unnessesary occurences of double types in the GUI. Elements don't need positions and sizes finer than pixels (lol)
X Make Vector2D<int> called Point2D, and make it a template because sometimes integers are more appropriate than doubles
X Make the use of floats and ints more logical in Sprite, SpriteFill, and SpriteFrame

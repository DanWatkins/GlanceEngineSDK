GlanceEngineSDK
===============

The GlanceEngine was a game engine I wrote during my high-school years. Only part of the project's history is in the commit history. It is written in C++ and uses SFML for rendering, input and audio. It is a 2.5D-shooter with a 3D coordinate system but 2D sprites. The project was officially started on April 17, 2010. The first major rewrite occured on February 6, 2011. The last major rewrite occured September 28, 2011.
